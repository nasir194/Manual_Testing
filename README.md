# Manual_Testing

"""Feature 1
In an MFS mobile app named EasyPay, customers can pay any merchant and utility bills.

* For each merchant bill payment, a 1% service charge will be deducted from the customer's balance, with a minimum transaction fee of 5 TK.
* If a customer makes a transaction of more than 5000 TK, they will get a 10% cashback.
* If the customer makes a transaction of more than 10,000 TK, they will receive a maximum of 20% cashback, capped at 3000 TK.
* No cashback will be applied for utility bills.

Feature 2
If a customer has a balance of less than 100 TK, they can apply for a loan of up to 20,000 TK.

* If the customer repays the loan within 30 days from the loan initiation day, no interest will be charged.
* If the customer fails to repay within this period, a daily interest of 1.8% (compound) will be applied on the remaining amount.
* If a customer has already paid 50% of the remaining payment, they are eligible to apply for another loan. """
